### Computational Physics Portfolio

This project based computational physics course allowed students to create, validate and communicate models of physical systems. Topics explored throughout the course include ordinary differential equations and data analysis and the skills learned in this course can be applied to various fields. 

A majority of programming was done in [Python]( https://vpython.org/)—gaining a familiarity with global and local variables, functions and lists. The numerous ways of creating graphs and other visualizations of data allowed for students to represent measured and simulated data visually using histograms, animations, 2D and 3D plots as well as contour plots. Although students were taught how to code for specific situations, students were also allowed to explore and investigate problems within science through assignments and projects. Each one of my projects were related to biochemistry or chemistry, to explore the use of computational modeling throughout various areas of science. 

I wanted to take this course to be expose myself to computational modeling and to learn more about translating tasks into the appropriate code. I was unsure if I would be overwhelmed in this course with my little exposure to code, however, Dr. Titus assured me this course would be something I could handle. 

I want to thank **Dr. Aaron Titus** for motivating me to take this course, being patient with me in class and for aiding me with each one of my projects. 

### Notebook

[Exploration of Neon]( https://github.com/mlucas2/Computational-Portfolio/blob/main/Exploration-of-Neon.ipynb)
-	The behavior of monoatomic Neon atoms under an Ideal Gas Law model was investigated. Manipulations to the temperature of the system allowed for conclusions to be made regarding the difference in conditions. 

[Enzyme Kinetics](https://github.com/mlucas2/Computational-Portfolio/blob/main/Enzyme-Kinetics.ipynb)
-	The relationship between the concentrations of Enzyme, Substrate, and Product within a system was explored. Utilizing the differential equations to each of the variables of interest, the initial values of each involved in the catalysis of biological systems is dependent on one another. 

[Dose-Response Curve](https://github.com/mlucas2/Computational-Portfolio/blob/main/Dose-Response-Curve.ipynb)
-	The replication of dose-response data from a computational program often used for the visualization of dose-response experiments was attempted. The non-linear regression curve-fit parameters produced were not 100% accurate, however investigations were made to replicate this data both graphically and numerically. 

[Vibrational Modeling of HCN](https://github.com/mlucas2/Computational-Portfolio/blob/main/Vibrational-Modeling-of-HCN.ipynb)
-	The vibrational modes of Hydrogen Cyanide were explored through modeling the compound as a ball and spring model. Using the IR data provided from Purdue University, the bond stiffnesses of the H – C bond and C – N bond were determined. Comparisons were made regarding the calculated stiffness of each bond, and if the values produced matched chemical theory. 

[Vibrational Modeling of Cyanogens](https://github.com/mlucas2/Computational-Portfolio/blob/main/Vibrational-Modeling-of-Cyanogens.ipynb)
-	An extension of the Investigations of HCN project examining the amplitudes of each atom produced when either Hydrogen or Nitrogen were displaced. Comparisons of the behavior of HCN and ICN were made to determine what characteristic of a compound effected its bond stiffness.
